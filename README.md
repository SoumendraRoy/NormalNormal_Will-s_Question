# This is a repository to address Prof. Will Farr's question on Normal-Normal model:

Here we generate the observations, $x_o$ as, $x_t \sim N(x_t|\mu, \sigma), ~ x_o \sim N(x_o|x_t, \sigma_o)$.

Now we select $x_o$'s with $x_o>x_{cut}$. In this repository, we explore how large $x_{cut}$ can be while still allowing us to infer $\mu$ and $\sigma$.
